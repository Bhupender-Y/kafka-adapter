# Pravega Kafka Adapter Samples

Examples in this module demonstrate the use of Kafka Adapter.

These examples are expected to be run interactively using the IDE (as of now). All examples are targeted
to an externally running Kafka cluster, so you must run a Kafka cluster before configuring and executing these samples.
